This is a collection of tools that I am using to manage the preparation of teaching videos.  
I mostly film videos using a DSLR and a lightboard, so I need to copy them from an SD card 
to a PC, reflect them horizontally, trim the ends, remove some parts where I am cleaning 
the board, upload the result to YouTube and/or Kaltura, and keep everything 
synchronised with other teaching material.
